# GPS_cate
data.generate.R includes the functions to generate simulated data for the various settings, include those seven settings presented in table 1.
RC.adjust.10level.R includes the functions to conduct RC-GPS approach using subclassifcation with 10 levels of subclasses.
RC_IPTW_trun.R conduct the functions to conduct RC-GPS approach using IPTW.
RC_matching.R conduct the functions to conduct RC-GPS approach using matching.

Bench_simulation.R conduct the simulation for the total of seven simulation settings. The code output Figure 1 in the main text and Figure A1-A8 in supplementary materials, as well as bias and mean square error for each setting.

Overlap 2.R check the overlap, and output Figure 2 in the main text.
standized_bias.R calculate the absolute standardized differences for each GPS approach, and output Figure 3 in the main text.
sensitivity analysis for transportability.R conduct the sensitivity analysis for each GPS approach, and output figure 4 in the main text, and figure A2 in supplementary materials.
